##  What's Inside

We’ve got small but mighty projects that let you flex essential JavaScript muscles:

- **Calculator** – Build logic around arithmetic operations and number formatting.
- **Flip Coin** – Practice randomness and state toggles (heads vs. tails).
- **Rock, Paper, Scissors** – Dive into conditional logic, event handling, and UI interaction.
- **To-Do List** – Toy with adding, marking, and removing tasks—great for DOM mastery.
- **(…and more under `~others`)** – Experiment, remix, and push your own boundaries.

Each sandbox is a chance to tinker with variables, functions, conditional flows, DOM manipulation, and event binding—core JavaScript essentials.
